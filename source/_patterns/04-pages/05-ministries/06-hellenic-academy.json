It started in 1920, as a Greek Language School, holding classrooms in several locations in East and Southwest Los Angeles, Hollywood, Huntington Park and San Pedro.</p><p>Teaching in satellite locations continued until 1957 when the Charles P. Skouras Memorial Centre opened its classrooms on the grounds of the beautiful Saint Sophia Cathedral.</p><p>In 1995, shortly after Father John Bakas became the Dean of Saint Sophia Cathedral, a new name was given to the Greek Language School, presently known as the Hellenic Academy. In anticipation of our marvelous new buildings, in the heart of the Byzantine-Latino Quarter, the academy, as a vital Ministry of Saint Sophia Cathedral, aims at further contributing to the cultural growth of the constantly developing area.</p><h3 id=\"philosophy-and-vision\">Philosophy and Vision</h3><p>The Hellenic Academy aims at providing an enriched and friendly learning environment through which children and adults can become conversant with the Greek language and culture. Our vision is to create and/or strengthen the bonds between people who value the essence of Hellenic heritage, letters, and Orthodox faith.</p><h3 id=\"our-program-for-children\">Our Program for Children</h3><p>Our educational program begins with familiarizing children with basic vocabulary groups related to their immediate environment. Through playful and interactive processes, children start to develop basic communication skills and understanding of simple linguistic structures. Methodically and gradually the program expands its focus to include the acquisition of more complex reading, writing, and communication skills.</p><p>At all levels, elements of mythology, history and folklore are incorporated. Children learn about the Greek Gods, Ancient Greek and Byzantine history, Customs of the Greek society, national struggles like the Oxi Day and the War of Independence. They participate in cultural events, such as the cutting of the Vasilopita, Greek Independence and Oxi Day Celebrations, and Palm Tying.</p><p>Children's classes are held every Saturday, from <strong>9:30 am to 12:00 pm.</strong></p><ul><li>Pre-K (must be at least 3 years old)</li><li>Kindergarten</li><li>Beginner Levels</li><ul><li>1A/1B - must be at least 5 years old</li><li>1B/2A</li><li>2A/2B</li></ul></li><li>Intermediate Levels</li><ul><li>2B/3A</li><li>3A/3B</li><li>3B/4A</li></ul></li><li>Advanced - Certificate of Attainment in Greek (Levels A-C): This course prepares the students for the yearly examinations leading to the Certificates of Attainment in Greek - issued by the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religion.</li></ul><p>More information on the Certification can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.greeklanguage.gr/certification/\" target=\"_blank\">www.greeklanguage.gr/certification/</a> and/or <a href=\"http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/certification/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/certification/index.html</a></p><h3 id=\"our-program-for-adults\">Our Program for Adults</h3><p>Adult courses in Modern Greek are offered for Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced levels.
