Our Nursery is available to children from birth to age 4, during the Divine Liturgy until 12:15pm. It is located at the <strong>south/east corner of the ground floor of the Huffington Center</strong>. Its dedicated entrance is directly across the parking lot from the north doors of the cathedral and our chapel. The beautiful bronze sculptures of children at play also are a guide to the entrance to our Nursery.</p>"
