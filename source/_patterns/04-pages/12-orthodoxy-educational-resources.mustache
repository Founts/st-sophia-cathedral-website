Icons: Iconography, or the symbolic depiction of Christ and the Saints, are a defining feature of Orthodox Christianity.  The seventh ecumenical council of the Church was convened to condemn the destruction and removal of icons from the church.  The icons were defended as testimonies to the incarnation of God in Christ.  God became touchable and depictable in Jesus and through His incarnation and ministry He sanctified creation.

The Saints: “Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us (Heb 12:1)” Orthodox Christians remember and honor the example laid before us by the multitude of great Christians who have testified to the resurrected life in Christ. We look to them for inspiration and for intercession for “the prayer of the righteous avails much.” 
Mary: 
Christ’s mother is greatly honored (as she prophesied in Luke 1:48 “Henceforth all generations shall call me blessed) for her role in our salvation.  She is honored as the Mother of God for it was through her that the Word of God took flesh and was born a child.  She is honored as the first among Christians because she was the first to receive Christ into her life and bear Him forth through Her life. Orthodox Christians do not worship anyone or anything but God. Orthodox Christians do give honor where God has ordained.

Ethnophyletism/Orthodox Nationalism: The distinction of races within the church is condemned as a heresy by the Orthodox. In 1872, the Church convened in Constantinople to discuss a situation where the faithful were beginning to divide themselves by race.  The wrote a decree proclaiming, “We censure, condemn, and declare contrary to the teachings of the Gospel and the sacred canons of the holy Fathers the doctrine of phyletism, or the difference of races and national diversity in the bosom of the Church of Christ”
1872 Council of Constantinople
